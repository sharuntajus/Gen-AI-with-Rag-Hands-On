# Generative AI with RAG – Hands-On Practice

This repository contains my hands-on exercises, projects, and notes from a course on **Generative AI with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. It includes practical work covering foundational to advanced topics like:

## What’s Included

- Understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Building your first RAG application
- Integrating vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate)
- Advanced RAG with embeddings, hybrid search, and context optimization
- Using LangChain, Ollama, and Mistral for local GenAI development

##  Technologies & Tools

- Python
- LangChain
- Ollama (local LLM runner)
- Mistral (open-source LLM)
- Chroma / FAISS / Weaviate (vector databases
- PyPDF, Unstructured, Sentence Transformers (for RAG pipelines)

## Goal

To gain real-world experience building, customizing, and scaling GenAI applications using modern open-source tools — with a strong focus on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
